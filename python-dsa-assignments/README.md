# Python DSA Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** assignments using Python.
The goal is to **document my learning journey** while practicing core concepts of programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

```
python-dsa-assignments/
â”œâ”€â”€ assignment1/   # OOP Basics in Python
â”œâ”€â”€ assignment2/   # Coming soon
â”œâ”€â”€ assignment3/   # Coming soon
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each folder represents one assignment, containing:

- `assignmentX.py` â†’ Python code for the assignment
- `README.md` â†’ Explanation of problems solved, key learnings, and how to run

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered

- Python fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Problem-solving techniques

## ðŸ“… Learning Journey

I will be **regularly updating this repository** with new assignments as I progress in my DSA with Python course.
This will serve as both a personal reference and a portfolio of my consistency in coding practice.
